    <p>Amazon.com is an e-commerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and
        software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and
        personal care products, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden
        items,
        musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies and
        consulting
        services. Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the US and amazon.co.uk for UK)
        though some offer international shipping.</p>

    <p>Visits to amazon.com grew from 615 million annual visitors in 2008, to more than 2 billion per month in
        2022. The e-commerce platform is the 14th most visited website in the world.</p>

    <p>Results generated by Amazon's search engine are partly determined by promotional fees. The company's
        localized
        storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code.</p>

    <p>Amazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa, Amazon Music, and
        Prime Video for music and videos respectively, the Amazon Appstore for Android apps, the Kindle line of eink
        e-readers, Fire and Fire HD color LCD tablets. Audible provides audiobooks for purchase and listening.</p>

    <p>In September 2021, Amazon announced the launch of Astro, its first household robot, powered by its Alexa smart
        home
        technology. This can be remote-controlled when not at home, to check on pets, people, or home security. It will
        send
        owners a notification if it detects something unusual.</p>

    <p>In January 2023, Amazon announced the launch of RXPass, a prescription drug delivery service. It allows U.S.
        Amazon
        Prime members to pay a $5 monthly fee for access to 60 medications. The service was launched immediately after
        the
        announcement except in states with specific prescription delivery requirements. Beneficiaries of government
        healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will not be able to sign up for RXPass.</p>

    <p>Amazon owns over 100 subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Kiva
        Systems (now Amazon Robotics), One Medical, Shopbop, Teachstreet, Twitch, Zappos, and Zoox.</p>
